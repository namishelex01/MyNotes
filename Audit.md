`path` | Records the full path of the file or directory that was passed to the system call as an argument in case of AVC-related Audit events
`perm` | Records the file permission that was used to generate an event (that is, read, write, execute, or attribute change)
`pid` | The pid field semantics depend on the origin of the value in this field.
| | In fields generated from user-space, this field holds a process ID.
| | In fields generated by the kernel, this field holds a thread ID. The thread ID is equal to process ID for single-threaded processes. Note that the value of this thread ID is different from the values of pthread_t IDs used in user-space. For more information, see the gettid(2) man page.
`ppid` | Records the Parent Process ID (PID).
`proctitle` | Records the full command-line of the command that was used to invoke the analyzed process. The field is encoded in hexadecimal notation to not allow the user to influence the Audit log parser. The text decodes to the command that triggered this Audit event. When searching Audit records with the ausearch command, use the -i or --interpret option to automatically convert hexadecimal values into their human-readable equivalents.

`res` | Records the result of the operation that triggered the Audit event.
`result` | Records the result of the operation that triggered the Audit event.
`saddr` | Records the socket address.
`sauid` | Records the sender Audit login user ID. This ID is provided by D-Bus as the kernel is unable to see which user is sending the original auid.
`ses` | Records the session ID of the session from which the analyzed process was invoked.
`sgid` | Records the set group ID of the user who started the analyzed process.
`sig` | Records the number of a signal that causes a program to end abnormally. Usually, this is a sign of a system intrusion.
